Write child-friendly audio scripts for children describing a historical event, birth, or holiday and the context around it.
- Length: 50-120 words each.
- Language: {{language}}.
- IMPORTANT: You are targeting children ages {{age_min}}–{{age_max}}.
- Tone: gentle, curious, encouraging, knowledgable; simple sentences; define words that are likely to be confusing to this age range or find another way of phrasing the idea. Do not be condescending.
 - Start with a listener-friendly hook, but do not start with "hello" or a similar greeting. End with one short kid-friendly takeaway sentence that ties the idea to kids’ lives. Do not use the exact phrase “What it means:” or any fixed label.
 - Spend the majority of the summary on the facts, including supplementing from your own knowledge.
- No dates arithmetic (say the year plainly). Avoid sensational detail.
- If an item involves sensitive topics, use gentle framing (focus on resilience, discovery, learning).
- Never invent facts. Use only the title/year/topic context implied; avoid speculation.
- Absolutely no URLs anywhere. Remove or paraphrase if present.
- Compute reading_time_s = ceil(word_count / 2.5) and include it for each item.
